Generate CRUDish API-endpoints for a model defined with the
[[https://github.com/phuhl/apparts-model][@apparts/model]] package.

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC js
npm i --save @apparts/model-api
#+END_SRC

* Usage

To generate CRUD-like API-endpoints for a model, use the =addCrud=
function.

- =addCrud({ prefix, app, model, routes, webtokenkey})=
  - =prefix : string= :: The prefix for the URI, can contain
    parameters (see next section).
  - =app : App= :: The express app
  - =model : function= :: A function that returns an array in
    the form of =[OneModel, ManyModel, NoneModel]= (as does the
    =makeModel= function from [[https://github.com/phuhl/apparts-model][@apparts/model]] package).
  - =routes : object= :: An object that contains options for the routes
    to be generated. If one of the keys is not present in the object,
    that route will not be generated. Possible keys are:
    - =get= :: The get all route
    - =getByIds= :: The get by ids route
    - =post= :: The create item route
    - =put= :: The update item route
    - =delete= :: The delete items route
    The values for each of these keys are objects, that can contain:
    - =access : (request, me) => boolean= :: A functions that defines
      access rights for the individual endpoint. It receives the same
      parameters as a request handler from [[https://github.com/phuhl/apparts-types][@apparts/types]] receives. It
      returns a boolean, that decides, if access should be granted or
      not.
    - =title : string= :: A custom title for the documentation
    - =description : string= :: A custom description for the
      documentation
  - =webtokenkey : string= :: The key to be used for the JWT
    verification (done by =prepauth.prepauthTokenJWT= from
    [[https://github.com/phuhl/apparts-types][@apparts/types]])

#+BEGIN_SRC js
const { addCrud, accessLogic: { anybody } } = require("@apparts/model");

const addRoutes = (app) => {
  // ...add your routes

  addCrud("/v/1/user", app, useUser, {
    get: anybody, getByIds: anybody, post: anybody, put: anybody, delete: anybody,
  });
};
#+END_SRC

Adds these routes:
- =GET /v1/user= :: The get all route (=get=)
- =GET /v/1/user/:ids= :: The get by ids route (=getByIds=)
- =POST /v/1/user= :: The create item route (=post=)
- =PUT /v/1/user/:id= :: The update item route (=put=)
- =DELETE /v/1/user/:ids= :: The delete items route (=delete=)

All these routes are secured by =prepauth.prepauthTokenJWT= from the
[[https://github.com/phuhl/apparts-types][@apparts/types]] package. That means, that requests have to contain a JWT that
is accepted by =prepauth.prepauthTokenJWT=. If you want to allow access
without an account, you can generate a JWT that serves as an API-Key
and provide it as the authentication on not-logged in users.

** Custom route prefixes for more REST-style access

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  const { addCrud, accessLogic: { anybody } } = require("@apparts/model");

  // create comment model with this type:
  const types = {
    id: { 
      type: "id",
      public: true,  
      auto: true,    
      key: true 
    },
    userid: { type: "id", public: true },
    createdOn: { 
      type: "time", 
      default: (c) => c.optionalVal || Date.now() 
    },
    comment: { type: "string", public: true },
  };

  // add routes
  addCrud("/v/1/user/:userid/comment", app, useComments, {
    get: anybody, getByIds: anybody, post: anybody, put: anybody, delete: anybody,
  });
#+END_SRC

Adds these routes:
- =GET /v/1/user/:userid/comment=
- =GET /v/1/user/:userid/comment/:ids=
- =POST /v/1/user/:userid/comment=
- =PUT /v/1/user/:userid/comment/:id=
- =DELETE /v/1/user/:userid/comment/:ids=

Note, that the parameter =userid= from the route is /automatically/
/matched/ against the =userid= field from the model.

** Custom access management

In the previous examples, all routes where created accessible for
anybody (with a valid JWT). That is most likely not what you
want. Instead, you can define a function for each crud operation that
returns a boolean. This function receives all parameters of the
API-call and uses them to determine if access should be granted. Only
if it returns =true=, access will be granted. The function can be =async=,
too.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  addCrud("/v/1/user/{userid}/comment", app, useComments, {
    get: async ({ dbs, params: { userid } }, me) => {
      // I can only list comments from my friends
      const [,User] = useUser(dbs);
      const meUser = await new User().loadById(me.userid);
      return meUser.content.friends.indexOf(userId) !== -1;
    },
    // I can read every commend I have the id for
    getByIds: () => true,
    // I can only post comments in my name
    post: ({ params: { userid } }, me) => userid === me.userid,
    // I can only edit my own comments
    put: ({ params: { userid } }, me) => userid === me.userid,
    // I can only delete my own comments
    delete: ({ params: { userid } }, me) => userid === me.userid,
  });
#+END_SRC

For convenience some helpers are defined that support combining
multiple access decider functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  const { addCrud, accessLogic: { or, orS, anybody } } = require("@apparts/model");

  const isAdmin = (_, { role }) => role === "admin";
  const isUser = ({ params: { userid } }, me) => userid === me.userid;
  const canListUsers = (ps) => {
    // ...
  };

  addCrud("/v/1/user/{userid}/", app, useComments, {
    // here, use "orS" to reduce database load (as orS is lazy) or "or" to optimize for return time
    get: orS(isAdmin, canListUsers),
    getByIds: anybody,
    post: isUser,
    put: or(isAdmin, isUser),
    delete: or(isAdmin, isUser),
  });
#+END_SRC

The helper functions are:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
// check all conditions in parallel
const and = (...fs) => async (...params) => await Promise.all(fs.map(f => f(params...)));
const or = (...fs) => async (...params) => await Promise.race(fs.map(f => f(params...)));

// check all conditions in sequence
const andS = (...fs) => async (...params) => await fs.reduce(async (a, b) => await a && await b(), Promise.resolve(true));
const orS = (...fs) => async (...params) => await fs.reduce(async (a, b) => await a || await b(), Promise.resolve(false));

// anybody
const anybody = () => true;
#+END_SRC

** Special parameters in the model

When defining the type of your model, you can use all the parameters
as defined by [[https://github.com/phuhl/apparts-model][@apparts/model]] (e.g. =public=, =mapped=, =optional=, =derived=,
=auto=). The generated API endpoints respect these values:

- Only types with =public: true= are shown on GET and can be set with
  POST and PUT
- Types with =mapped: true= are shown to the outside with their mapped names
- Types with =optional: true= are optional and don't have to be set
- Types with =auto= or a =derived= function can not be set on PUT or POST
- The =derived= function can be used to fetch sub object as the =derived=
  function is called asynchronously.

Additionally, @apparts/model-api respects the value =readOnly=:

- Types with =readOnly: true= can only be read. It's value have to be
  created with a =default= function. This can be useful, e.g. for a
  created date, that should be readable (i.e. public) but not be
  modifiable.
